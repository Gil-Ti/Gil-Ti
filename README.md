## 🧭 Strategic Vision

I am a multidisciplinary leader sitting at the intersection of **Technology, Business, and Governance**. With a unique background spanning **Pedagogy, Business Administration, and Software Engineering**, I translate complex regulatory requirements into fluid, user-centric digital experiences.

Currently, as **IT Manager & DPO at Open Soluções Tributárias**, I lead the development of B2B SaaS solutions that navigate the intricate Brazilian tax landscape. My focus is not just on shipping code, but on delivering **compliant, secure, and high-value products** that solve real pains for tax and accounting departments.

> *"My goal is to abstract bureaucracy through technology, ensuring that compliance is a seamless feature, not a hurdle."*
