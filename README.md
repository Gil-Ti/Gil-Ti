## 🧭 About Me

I’m a multidisciplinary professional with solid experience in **technology, product, and governance**.  
I hold degrees in **Pedagogy**, **Business Administration**, and a **postgraduate specialization in Software Engineering**.

Currently, I work as **IT Manager** and **DPO** at Open Soluções Tributárias, where I lead the team responsible for a **SaaS** system focused on the tax sector. My role goes beyond technical leadership — I actively contribute to product strategy, backlog prioritization, discovery, cross-functional integration, and decision-making focused on customer value.

📌 I'm currently studying at **PM3**, developing a strategic product vision with an emphasis on discovery, metrics, agility, and business impact.
